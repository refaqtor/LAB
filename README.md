##Sciencechain [LAB]

This coin was originally released by Coinworksdotinfo as "Coinlabcoin" and then "Coinworkscoin." It is a CPU based 11-hash cryptographic blockchain token based on Bitcoin and Quark. 

It was fairly launched, had zero premine, and a rapid distribution to 1,000,000 coins with ongoing proof of work at one coin per block for ever.

This coin was abandoned when Coinworks went offline, but Cryptsy and Bittrex had listed it.

In the spirit of maintaining this technically sound and enticingly valuable token alive, I've decided to rebrand and update it. The wallet has been updated to Core level code, based on Quark. 100% compatible with the original chain, no swapouts required and already listed on a prominent exchange.

Enjoy the rebirth of LAB: Sciencechain.
